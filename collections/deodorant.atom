<p>Your personal microbiome ecosystem is a vital part of your overall health. The microbiome of your armpits is created by the trillions of bacteria and other microorganisms that coexist peacefully. Unlike antiperspirants that disrupt your natural microbiome with toxins and chemicals that kill bacteria, a natural aluminum-free deodorant helps your microbiome thrive and supports the balance of healthy bacteria<em>.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><em>Coconut Oil:</em></strong><span> </span>provides deep moisture without making your skin oily.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Shea Butter:</em></strong><span> </span>Using shea butter on your body, especially your face, can condition, tone, and soothe your skin.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Zinc oxide:</strong><span> </span></em>is a mineral that’s popular as an alternative to triclosan and baking soda in natural products like sunscreen, diaper cream, and shampoo. It works externally by converting the short fatty acids that produce odor-creating bacteria into odorless zinc salts. This safely creates a protective barrier on the skin and reduces odor-causing bacteria by minimizing the growth of new bacteria.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Magnesium:</strong> </em>One of the most essential yet underrated nutrients out there. It’s needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions, which means that magnesium deficiency causes a wide range of serious health problems. Believe it or not, low magnesium levels may even cause your sweat to smell worse.
<p>By selecting a natural deodorant that contains magnesium, you effortlessly supplement your body’s magnesium, which helps fight pit odor internally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people weighing the decision to switch to a natural aluminum-free deodorant are concerned about the efficiency of natural deodorant. If you’re one of them, you’ll be surprised to learn that natural deodorant is<span> </span><em>more<span> </span></em>effective than standard aluminum-based deodorant, as long as you give your body a few weeks to adjust.</p>
<p>When you start transitioning to natural deodorant, your pores and cells need a few weeks to detox aluminum, parabens, and other common chemicals lurking in your old deodorant. It takes time and patience, but it’s completely worth it in the end to enjoy a deodorant that delivers results without harming your health.</p>
